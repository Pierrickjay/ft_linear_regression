# ft_linear_regression
This repository is an introduction to machine learning.

TrainModel will find theta0 and theta1 thanks to a gradient descend algorithm, just pass your datafile as argument to the program.

The estimate price program will then predict the price of a car by using a linear function.

The precision program will calculate the precision of your algo.

The data_visualiser will show your data plotted to a graph. If you have trained your algo he will also plot the resulting line of the gradient descent algo.
